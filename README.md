# writeups
Here is a collection of my writeups on the topic of reverse engineering and binary exploitation. All of them make use of free (as in freedom) open source software.

## rhme2

This is what worths to be shared of my work on Riscure's [rhme2 challange](http://rhme.riscure.com/challenges)

- [fridge vm plugin for radare2](https://github.com/mrmacete/writeups/tree/master/rhme2/fridge-plugin)
- [Owning the fridge (as a software guy)](https://github.com/mrmacete/writeups/tree/master/rhme2/writeups/owning_the_fridge.md)

I'll write something up later, if it turns out i did something different than the most ranked teams.
